"Simply put, this site was created to fill a void that was created by "
"curiosity.  I was interested in not just how I was doing at the moment I was "
"streaming, but how I had been doing over time - and the tools around this "
"kind of information were not in place at livecoding.tv.  So I got to work "
"and created a quick prototype version of this site and realized that by "
"capturing the amount of data that I was, the streamers could see their data "
"in many ways. I decided to become serious and actually build something that "
"users can signup for, integrate with their channel, and utilize."
